# nuxt-sails

a [Sails](https://sailsjs.com) + [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) + [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) application


This project was made as a concept proof of sails + nuxt working together and using Vuetify
as the ui framework

Prerequisites as far as I know:
- node 6
- eslint

and any other prerequisites of sails, nuxt and vuetify

Recommended: `node 8`

the easiest way to give it a spin on dev mode is running it as the following

- `git clone https://github.com/AngelMunoz/sails-nuxt.git`
- `npm install`
- `NODE_ENV=development node app.js --dev --port=3000 --log.level=sily`

on windows just omit the `NODE_ENV` part
if you want to reload the serverside part of the framework consider `pm2` or `nodemon`

if you are using vscode it is pretty easy to debug the serverside
just press <kbd>F5</kbd> *(after npm install of course)* and that should get you up and running
